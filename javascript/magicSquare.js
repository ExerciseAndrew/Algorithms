/*  
    a magic square is defined as an n x n matrix of distinct
    positive integers from 1 to n^2
    where the sum of any row, column, or diagongal of length
    'n' is always equal to the same number: the magic constant
    
    You will be given a 3x3 matrix 's' of integers in that 
    inclusive range [1,9]. We can convert any digit to any 
    other digit in the range 1-9 at the cost of a-b
    Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimul cost.
    Print this cost on a new line.
