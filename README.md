# Algorithms
I want to solve all of the puzzles. 

5/12/20- I'm starting to stand on solid ground here. This coding stuff is full of pit-falls, but if I ignore the dread that contaminates the more difficult realms of study then I can stay on top of this. I've developed some goals and interests.
I want to interface my algorithms with a stack file that I made. I want this to be able to run on another machine pretty easily and, perhaps it is because I am a beginner but I don't know how easy or hard that is to do. I think that is a big reason why Github is so widely used, so I will refer to the whimsy I cook up next time I start practicing branching.
I've been trying to figure out how to work with JSON serialization/deserialization. It isn't really clicking naturally, but I am able to run my text based game using JSON to store map data and I think I can incorporate that into my work with the algorithms as I try to build test-cases for larger numbers.
From here it seems like a pipe-dream, but I can do a lot in one day and I can spend days and days knocking my head against this if it means I'll unlock more 'secrets'.
